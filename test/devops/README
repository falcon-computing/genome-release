# Launching an AWS instance;
# AWS instances are launched from the falcon-aws script which lives in the internal repo
# git clone git@github.com:falcon-computing/internal.git
# The aws instance can be launched with the following command format; 

internal/aws-manage/falcon-aws request -i ami-09f8aee7a4f413042 -t chrisTesting -d f1.16xlarge --no-conf

# This will generate some text output, then spit out an IP. Keep track of this.
# This image has ssh credentials and the IP is ready to be passed in to prepare_aws_instance.sh.

# Notes:
# -t labels the instance, use something descriptive
# -d specifies the instance type. Some populare ones are f1.16xlarge m5.12xlarge and m4.10xlarge
# The instance default to shutting down if idle for a couple minutes. This can be turned off by adding
#      the --no-alarm command.
